There are some design decisions that need to be made before Sublime can be
properly supported. Your feedback would be very helpful - please comment on
[issue 68](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/68) and
[issue 74](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/74).

Installation

1) Download the `.tmTheme` file
2) In Sublime, open preferences -> browse packages. This will open a directory
in your file browser.
3) Create a `Themes` folder if it doesn't exist
4) put the theme file in that folder
5) in Sublime, pick the theme in preferences -> color schemes
