Selenized color palette
=======================

Selenized is a color theme for terminals and text editors, carefully designed
using professional-grade [CIE
L*a*b*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) color space for maximum
readability and great eye comfort.


Design principles
-----------------

- make the contrast just right: strong but not tiring to the eyes
- adjust lightness of all colors for uniform readability
- select colors in a way that boosts code comprehension
- make it as beautiful and visually pleasing as possible

Read more about the design [here](features-and-design.md).

ðŸ”¥ **I need your opinion!** ðŸ”¥ There are some design decisions that need to be made
before adding support for more editors. Your feedback would be very helpful -
please comment on
[issue 68](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/68) and
[issue 74](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/74).


### Other applications

- [Dircolors](other-apps/dircolors) (file coloring rules for CLI utilities like `ls`)
- [i3](other-apps/i3) window manager and status line
- [Manpage coloring](other-apps/selenized-man)
- [Midnight Commander](other-apps/mc) skin
- [Rofi](other-apps/rofi) window switcher
- [Slack](other-apps/slack) sidebar theme
- [Wofi](other-apps/wofi) (wayland replacement for Rofi)

### Manual installation

If your application is not listed above, you can manually copy [hex
values](the-values.md) into its preferences.  Please consider sending me a pull
request with the resulting configuration so that I can add it to officially
supported terminals :-)



Palette variants
----------------

### Selenized dark

Like _Solarized dark_, but better.



### Selenized black

Oldschool black-and-white look with a little more contrast.



### Selenized light

A warm sepia variant, corresponding to _Solarized light_.



### Selenized white

Unlike many dark-on-white palettes, yellow color is readable here.



What about _Solarized_?
-----------------------

There is a popular color palette named _Solarized_. I really liked the design
principles behind Solarized, but it has a couple issues, which [Selenized
solves](whats-wrong-with-solarized.md).

By the way, the name is derived from the greek word "selene", which means
the moon (as opposed to the sun in Solarized).



Known issues
------------

Some command-line programs need reconfiguration to look good with Selenized,
because they make assumptions about the colors configured in terminal (see
[this issue](https://github.com/janek-warchol/selenized/issues/7) for details):

- [`ls`](dircolors/)
- [Midnight Commander](mc/)
