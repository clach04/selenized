There are some design decisions that need to be made before Notepad++ can be
properly supported. Your feedback would be very helpful - please comment on
[issue 68](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/68) and
[issue 74](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/74).


Installation
------------

1. Copy the `.xml` file to Notepad++ `themes` directory. This can be
   `%PROGRAMFILES%\Notepad++\themes\` or
   `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes`, for example.
2. Go to Settings -> Style configurator and choose "Selenized" as the theme.
