--------------

There are some design decisions that need to be made before Kate can be
properly supported. Your feedback would be very helpful - please comment on
[issue 68](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/68) and
[issue 74](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/issues/74).


Installation:
- download `.kateschema` file
- in Kate's settings, go to Fonts and Colors and click "Import" to import the
  schema. You may have to type the name of the file (Kate may not autodetect
  it).
